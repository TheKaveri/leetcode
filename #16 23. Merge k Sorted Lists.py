# Let's find the time complexity of this one.
# Assume k different linked-lists each of length c.
# (i.e. k = len(lists) and c = len(lists[i]) for all i)
# Note that we have k * c distinct ListNodes.

# If it takes T(k) time to merge 'lists', then it 
# takes roughly T(k/2) time to merge it's two halves
# 'left_half' and 'right_half'.

# Each merged halves (i.e. merged_left_half and merged_right_half) 
# will have (k * c) / 2 ListNodes in them since 'lists' has (k * c)
# ListNodes. Hence, it'll take  O(kc/2 + kc/2) = O(kc) time to merge 
# the two halves.

# Therefore:
# T(k) = Î˜(1), if k <= 2
# T(k) = 2 * T(k/2) + k * c, if k > 2 where c is the constant.

# By Master's Theorem:
# T(k) = k * log(k) is the time complexity and we take O(logk) extra
# space due to recursion.

# Phew! First ever Leetcode hard problem done. YAY :)
